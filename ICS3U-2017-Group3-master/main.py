# This program is the first file in a multi-scene game template
#    This template is meant to be used with the Xcode template,
#    to make apps for the App Store.
#
# Originally from: Ole Zorn, from the Xcode template
# for use with https://github.com/omz/PythonistaAppTemplate
# Also from the Pythonista community forum.
#
# This file creates the UIView that will be used by Xcode,
#  then creates the scene inside it. once everything is ready
#  to go, the scene transitions immediately to the first scene.
# It is assumed you bring along all your assets, 
#   and not use any of the mornal ones built into Pythonista.
#y
# To exit the app in Pythonista, pull down with 2 fingers.
